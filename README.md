## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this yourself, you'll need a Github account and a few environment variables. These include a `DATABASE_URL` to your Briefkasten database. As well as the connection details to your image hosting service, in this case [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io).

1. Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Tuscan-blue/briefkasten-scrape.git
$ cd briefkasten-scrape
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the file `.env` accordingly

```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
$ vim .env
```
#### **File `.env.example` for reference**

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://bkAdmin:briefkasten@postgres:5432/briefkasten?sslmode=disable

SUPABASE_KEY=
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_BUCKET_ID=

BOOKMARKS_CHUNK=10
```

3. Build Docker container

```sh
$ docker build . -t briefkasten-scrape:latest
```

This will execute and fetch the first 10 Bookmarks with missing cover images and attempt to capture them with Playwright. They will be uploaded to your image store of choice and then displayed for the user the next time they open their Briefkasten.
